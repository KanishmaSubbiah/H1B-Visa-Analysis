                              **H-1B Visa Analysis and Data Visualization**
 
**Abstract**
The H-1B visa is a temporary work visa that allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialized occupations. This analysis aims to examine H-1B visa trends, policy changes, and the economic impact of the program on the US labor market. The project analyzes historical data, visa application, and approval data, and provides insights into the ongoing debates and implications of the H-1B program for US immigration policy and the economy.
Introduction
The H-1B visa program provides temporary employment opportunities for foreign workers in specialized fields. Fluctuations in visa applications and the impact of natural disasters such as COVID-19 need to be analyzed. The analysis aims to identify trends, examine the characteristics of visa holders, and evaluate the program's impact on wages, job opportunities, and economic growth.

**Problem Statement**
In today's data-driven world, analyzing vast amounts of data can be challenging. Effective data analysis is crucial for understanding trends and patterns. The project focuses on key questions such as visa application trends, visa status, employer hubs, salary comparisons, job markets, top employers, and visa holders by state.

**Methodology**
Data for H-1B visa analysis from 2019 to 2021 (Q1) is sourced from the U.S. Department of Labor's Foreign Labor Certification Data Center. The dataset includes information on case numbers, status, dates, job titles, employer details, wages, and prevailing wages. The dataset is cleaned and standardized using Tableau's data cleaning tools.

**Data Analysis and Visualization**
Various visualizations are created to analyze the data.
